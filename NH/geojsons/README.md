# Lab_02 Home State Map

## State Information
    The overview for lab_02 says to use your home state.  I grew up in Brentwood, New Hampshire so I chose New Hampshire as my state for this project. In the Required Specifications of the Deliverable section it says pick any state. I went to the University of Montana for my undergrad and I think Montana would have been interesting with the amount of waterways. Maybe I'll use Montana for the next one!
